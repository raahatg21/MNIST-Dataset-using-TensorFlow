# MNIST-Dataset-using-TensorFlow

  The Dataset consists of 28 x 28 greyscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). And our goal is to identify the digit. There are 60,000 training examples, and further 10,000 test examples.
  
  I've implemented three different basic techniques: simple Logistic Regression (1_Logistic_Regression.ipynb, **90.9% Validation Accuracy**), Multilayered Perceptron (2_MLP.ipynb, **96.41% Validation Accuracy**), and ConvNet(3_ConvNet.ipynb, **99.04% Validation Accuracy**).
  
  All implementations are made using **TensorFlow**. This example was inspired by **TensorFlow Cookbook** written by Antonio Gulli and Amita Kapoor.
  
  The files are created in Google Colab. Link is included.
  
  Comments and Suggestions are welcome :)
